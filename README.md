Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview

This project explores customer churn patterns using an end-to-end data analysis and visualization workflow. The objective was to identify key drivers of churn and present insights in a clear, business-friendly dashboard using Power BI.

Rather than focusing solely on aesthetics, this case study emphasizes data storytelling — transforming raw customer data into insights that stakeholders can act on.
